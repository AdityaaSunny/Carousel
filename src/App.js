Hexacopters hold a promise for quickly and efficiently delivering medical supplies, such as blood, to remote or inaccessible areas. This report describes the design and development of a hexacopter capable of carrying a 500 gm payload, specifically designed to transport medical blood bags from one hospital to another within 1 km distance within 10 to 15 minutes.

    review: `The development of hexacopter drones for emergency blood treatment requires a focus on efficiency, reliability, and payload capacity. One crucial aspect of drone design is the frame, which serves as a major structural member carrying the weight of the entire drone and housing essential sensors.
    By optimizing the frame design through generative design techniques, significant weight reduction can be achieved, thereby increasing the drone's payloadÂ capacity.`
